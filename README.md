## Hi everyone, this is the GPU assignment information for ImagingLab@ZJU.

### For protection, we mask some IP address, please ask the manager for details.

### Some issues after assignment
- Some GPUs has **"User"** and **"Sub User"**, you two guys have the **same execution** on this GPU, but the **decision** is made by the **"User"**.
- **ATTENTION: the User of "GPU: 0" is the Manager of this Server**
- If you has the demands for distributed training, **contact the "User"** of your intended GPU or **contact your Supervisor** for cloud service.

### These regulations are still subject to change (**including the detailed assignment of each GPU**). Once update, we will inform every one.
